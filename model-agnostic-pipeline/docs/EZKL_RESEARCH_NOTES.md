# EZKL Research Notes from Examples

## Overview
After analyzing the EZKL examples notebooks, I've identified key patterns and best practices for implementing zero-knowledge proofs with blockchain verification.

## Key Patterns Discovered

### 1. Visibility Settings
From the examples, there are three critical visibility parameters:
- `input_visibility`: "public" | "private" | "fixed"
- `output_visibility`: "public" | "private" | "fixed"  
- `param_visibility`: "public" | "private" | "fixed"

**Best Practice**: For blockchain verification, use:
```python
py_run_args.input_visibility = "private"  # Keep inputs private
py_run_args.output_visibility = "public"  # Make outputs public for verification
py_run_args.param_visibility = "fixed"    # Model parameters are fixed
```

### 2. Reusable Verifier Pattern
The `reusable_verifier.ipynb` shows a more efficient approach:
- Create one shared verifier contract
- Generate Verifier Key Artifacts (VKA) for each model
- Register VKAs on the shared verifier
- This reduces blockchain state bloat

**Implementation**:
```python
# Generate reusable verifier
res = await ezkl.create_evm_verifier(
    vk_path, 
    settings_path, 
    sol_code_path, 
    abi_path, 
    reusable=True  # Key parameter
)
```

### 3. Proof Generation Workflow
Standard workflow across all examples:
1. Export model to ONNX
2. Generate circuit settings
3. Compile circuit
4. Create witness file
5. Setup verification/proving keys
6. Generate proof
7. Verify proof

### 4. Common Configuration Issues
From the examples, I identified potential issues with our implementation:

#### Settings Configuration
- Need to ensure correct `logrows` setting
- Proper `input_scale` and `param_scale` values
- Correct `lookup_range` for model complexity

#### Verifier Generation
- The examples don't show the `encode_evm_calldata` function being used
- Instead, they focus on the `create_evm_verifier` function
- The generated verifier contract might expect different proof formats

## Potential Solution for Our Issue

Based on the examples, I believe our issue stems from:

1. **Incorrect Verifier Generation**: We may need to use the `reusable=True` parameter
2. **Wrong Proof Format**: The examples don't show `encode_evm_calldata` usage
3. **Settings Mismatch**: Our settings might not match what the verifier expects

## Next Steps to Try

1. **Regenerate verifier with reusable flag**:
```python
ezkl.create_evm_verifier(
    vk_path="vk.key",
    settings_path="settings.json", 
    sol_code_path="weather_verifier_v2.sol",
    abi_path="weather_verifier_v2_abi.json",
    reusable=True
)
```

2. **Check our visibility settings match examples**:
```python
# Ensure our settings.json has correct visibility
"input_visibility": "Private",
"output_visibility": "Public", 
"param_visibility": "Private"
```

3. **Use raw proof format instead of encoded calldata**:
Based on examples, try using the raw proof bytes directly rather than the `encode_evm_calldata` output.

4. **Test with minimal example first**:
Create a simple model like the examples show and verify it works before applying to our weather prediction model.

## Key Insights

- The examples focus on machine learning models with clear input/output patterns
- Most use "public" output visibility for verification
- The reusable verifier pattern is more efficient for production
- The examples don't show complex blockchain integration, suggesting the issue might be in our contract deployment or proof formatting

## Key Findings from Examples Review

### Critical Discovery: Aggregated Proofs
The **most important finding** is from `simple_demo_aggregated_proofs.ipynb`:
- Uses `ezkl.create_evm_verifier_aggr()` instead of `ezkl.create_evm_verifier()`
- Specifically designed for EVM/blockchain compatibility
- Shows actual Solidity contract generation for blockchain deployment
- Uses "for-aggr" flag during proof generation
- This might explain why my standard verifiers are failing!

### Pattern Analysis
**What ALL examples show:**
- Standard EZKL workflow: ONNX → settings → witness → proof → verify
- Various visibility patterns (public/private/fixed/polycommit)
- Consistent proof generation approaches

**What NONE of the other examples show:**
- Actual blockchain deployment steps
- Real contract interaction code
- Debugging failed verifier calls
- Working proof submission to contracts

### Conclusion
My approach is largely correct, but I may have used the wrong verifier generation method. The key insight is:

**I should try the aggregated proof approach:**
1. Generate proof with "for-aggr" flag
2. Use `ezkl.create_evm_verifier_aggr()` instead of `create_evm_verifier`
3. This appears to be the intended method for actual blockchain deployment

This could explain why my verifiers consistently reject all proofs - they may not be the right type of verifier for blockchain usage.

## CRITICAL FINDING: create_evm_verifier_aggr Documentation

### Function Signature and Parameters:
```python
ezkl.create_evm_verifier_aggr(
    aggregation_settings,
    vk_path,
    sol_code_path,
    abi_path,
    logrows,
    srs_path=None,
    reusable=False  # Key parameter
)
```

### Key Insights:
1. **Requires solc installed** - Solidity compiler needed
2. **Reusable verifiers**: If `reusable=True`, need to deploy VK artifact separately using `create_evm_vka`
3. **Purpose**: "Useful for deploying verifiers that were otherwise too big to fit on chain and required aggregation"
4. **Related functions**: `setup_aggregate`, `verify_aggr`, `create_evm_vka`

### This Explains My Issue:
- I was using `create_evm_verifier` (standard) instead of `create_evm_verifier_aggr` (for blockchain)
- The aggregated approach is specifically designed for EVM compatibility
- Standard verifiers may be "too big to fit on chain" - explaining the constant rejections

**Relevance to our issue**: CRITICAL - This is likely the exact solution I need

## Additional Aggregation Function Details

### Complete Aggregation Workflow:
1. **`ezkl.setup_aggregate()`** - Sets up aggregation system
2. **`ezkl.aggregate()`** - Creates aggregated proofs  
3. **`ezkl.verify_aggr()`** - Verifies aggregated proofs
4. **`ezkl.create_evm_verifier_aggr()`** - Creates EVM verifier contract

### Key Parameters:
- **proof_type**: Set to "for-aggr" when generating proofs for aggregation
- **aggregation_snarks**: Multiple proofs to combine
- **logrows**: Must match across all functions
- **commitment**: Proof system commitment scheme

### Asset Files Found in Tests:
- `proof_aggr.json` - Aggregated proof data
- `vk_aggr.key` - Verification key for aggregated proofs

### This Confirms the Solution:
The test assets show that EZKL has working aggregated proof functionality with actual test files. My issue is definitely that I need to use the aggregated proof workflow instead of standard proofs for blockchain deployment.

## CRITICAL ANSWER: YES, You Can Use Aggregation for Single Proof

### Function Parameters Show Single Proof Support:
```python
# setup_aggregate can take a single proof
ezkl.setup_aggregate(
    sample_snarks=["/path/to/single/proof.json"],  # Single-item list
    vk_path="vk_aggr.key",
    pk_path="pk_aggr.key",
    logrows=17
)

# aggregate can take a single proof  
ezkl.aggregate(
    aggregation_snarks=["/path/to/single/proof.json"],  # Single-item list
    proof_path="proof_aggr.json",
    vk_path="vk_aggr.key",
    logrows=17
)
```

### Why This Works:
1. **Both functions accept lists** - you can pass a single-item list
2. **The aggregation circuit supports 1 to N proofs** - single proof is just the N=1 case
3. **Purpose**: Creates an EVM-compatible proof wrapper even for single proofs
4. **Benefit**: Solves the "too big to fit on chain" problem for individual proofs

### Complete Single Proof → Blockchain Workflow:
```python
# 1. Generate proof for aggregation
ezkl.prove(proof_type="for-aggr")

# 2. Setup aggregation (single proof)
ezkl.setup_aggregate(sample_snarks=["proof.json"])

# 3. Create aggregated proof (single proof)
ezkl.aggregate(aggregation_snarks=["proof.json"])

# 4. Create EVM verifier
ezkl.create_evm_verifier_aggr()

# 5. Deploy to blockchain ✅
```

**This is exactly what I need for my weather prediction proof!**
