# Fluence Network Integration

## About Fluence

[Fluence Network](https://www.fluence.network/) is a revolutionary decentralized "Cloudless" computing platform that provides a global, permissionless, scalable, and secure alternative to centralized cloud providers. Built on DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) principles, Fluence offers compute resources that are up to 80% cheaper than traditional cloud services while being both resilient and verifiable.

## Why Fluence for Heavy ZK Compute

For our ZK proof computation workloads in this project, Fluence proved to be an excellent choice because:

### üöÄ **Easy Setup & High RAM Machines**
Spinning up large RAM machines for heavy zero-knowledge computations was remarkably straightforward. The platform's infrastructure allowed us to quickly provision the computational resources needed for complex proof generation without the typical bureaucracy and delays of traditional cloud providers.

### üí∞ **Cost Efficiency** 
With costs 60-80% lower than centralized cloud providers, Fluence made it economical to run computationally intensive ZK workloads that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive.

### üîê **Cryptographic Verification**
Fluence's built-in cryptographic proof system ensures all computations are verifiable and tamper-resistant - perfect for ZK applications where computational integrity is paramount. The platform uses Proof of Capacity (PoC) protocols that can be verified by anyone.

### üåê **Decentralized Resilience**
The distributed nature of Fluence's network provides failover capabilities and load balancing, ensuring our ZK computations remain available even if individual nodes go offline.

## Our Experience

The convenience of booting up powerful machines for our ZK proof generation was remarkable. What typically involves lengthy approval processes and complex configurations with traditional cloud providers became a streamlined experience on Fluence's platform.

## Looking Forward: Custom Templates

We're excited about Fluence's roadmap and particularly look forward to them offering more custom templates specifically optimized for:

- **ZK Circuit Compilation Environments** - Pre-configured with tools like circom, snarkjs, and other ZK development frameworks
- **High-Memory Computing Templates** - Optimized configurations for memory-intensive proof generation
- **GPU-Accelerated ZK Templates** - For hardware-accelerated proof computation
- **Batch Processing Templates** - For efficient parallel proof generation workflows
